Pathfinding project is a plugin for Unity3D. It is based on A* algorithm for finding optimal path.

It runs on a grid based system. It has penalty features. Currently, agents request path and listens for pathfound event.

Desired features:

- Multi-threaded so that it could supports lots of agents
- Custom Editor for making it easy to use
- Smoothing and Straightening modifiers
